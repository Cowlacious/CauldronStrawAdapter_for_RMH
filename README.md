# CauldronStrawAdapter_for_RMH
These adapters were designed for use the components of the Floating Bottle Cauldron build at the 2025 Rocky Mountain Haunters gathering.
There are two parts, one that goes into the mouth of the bottle and one goes in the pump, with the straw inbetween them both. 
A video is included in the respository.

I have included both a Bamboo project file with both parts and separate STEP files of each part.
I printed these on a Bamboo A1 printer with PETG filament and supports turned on (the straw to pump adapter piece needs that).  

To download the files, just click on the file you want. A new page will open up and you can basically ignore what ever is on the page.
Go to the upper (but not all the way up) corner of the screen and click on the download symbol (downward arrow pointing to a desktop file holder) and it should download to your computer.
